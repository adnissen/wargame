# Elder Runes

## Factions
FACTION_0 - Known for harvesting the Runes for their raw power, FACTION_0 is the most aggressive and brutal of the armies at play.

FACTION_1 - Born out of their hatred for FACTION_0, no diplomatic ties to FACTION_2, and a lack of access to Runes, FACTION_1 uses older but more reliable technology to control the battlefield.

FACTION_2 - After being incredibly isolationist for as long as anyone can remember, the discovery of new Runes has spurred FACTION_2 to open their gates and assemble their armies once again.
